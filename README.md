# CinemaAppFrontend
## Introduction

Handling the activities related to the Cinema Industry. The main objective of this project is to develop a Cinema booking reservation app and its back-end services. This project is divided into two major sections:â€‹
- Cinema Side
* Movie Fan Side

This project will be based on the **CINEMA SIDE** of this appliaction.

## Basic Functionalities
- **Create / Edit Cinema Profile**: As a cinema side user, you can create and edit your account/profile, providing essential information to the system.
- **Cinema Login By Providing Credential**: Use Spring Security to protect and handle login functionalities.
- **Create / Edit Movies**: Add and edit movies and customize the movie details.
- **Manage Seat Inventory**: Add and update seat entries for the showtimes on show days.
- **Validate and Confirm Reservations**: Implement the seat reservation processes and validate bookings.

  
## Technologies and Architecture
- **Back end** - Developed using Java 8 and Spring Boot with Gradle.
- **Front end** - Used React and Ant Design UI library to create an interactive user interface.
- **Database** - MySQL is used for data storage, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- **Login Credential** - Used Role base authentication in Spring Security.
- **Inter-back-end Communication** - Apache Kafka is used for asynchronous communication between microservices.
- **Architecture** - Micro-service architecture is used.
- **Deployment** - Using Docker, dockerized all back-end services and front-end applications.
- **Version Control** - Git.

This Repository contains the complete backend of the Cinema Side of the application. you can find the complete frontend of the Cinema Side of this application here

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
